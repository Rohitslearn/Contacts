# Contacts
                                     Contacts App

1.Created a contacts app using Angular CI{version 14} ,nodejs and Bootstrap

2.Using Visual Studio Code Editor . I implemented the code

3.Created three components:  1. SignIn Component.
                             2.SignUp Component.
                             3.Contacst Component.
                             
4.Created Routing for Communicate between the Components.

5.Fire API and Methods for Storing data in JSON file.

6.Json server used for for fire api calling and storing the data when we enter our data in forms.

7.I inserted this contact app in Contacts App Project File.

8.Due to Large file I deleted Node-module.(for run the project must download the node-modules for the command prompt)

How it will process:

1.Unzip the file.

2.First import the file in visual studio then run the file using ng serve (command).after running the server it will provide the port (4200 port)

3.How I created components in angular is using: ng generate component component name
1.	ng generate component signup
2.	ng generate component signup
3.	ng generate component signup

4.add the routing : ng new angular-routing-demo â€“routing 

5.i used to store the data using json server.its is a fake server used to store the data in a json formate.
Command for run the json server is : json-server --watch db.json

It is a fake server helps to store the data.its acts like database.
